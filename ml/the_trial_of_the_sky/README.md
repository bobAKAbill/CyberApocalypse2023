# Cyber Apocalypse 2023

## The Trial of the Sky

> Pandora has finally retrivied the otherworldly relic. Now, she needs to board her spacecraft and hunt down those alien pods. Alas, there is so much even a cyborg can do. She will need all her focus tracking and hunting down these pods. Luckily for her, the spacecraft can be piloted using an AI controller. All that's left now is to calibrate the AI and let it do all the heavy work. Pandora has already chosen a track that would test the limits of AI piloting ensuring her safety and success.
