# Cyber Apocalypse 2023

## The Chasms Crossing Conundrum

> As you and your trusty team of local pyramid experts stand at the precipice of the chasm, you catch a glimpse of the otherworldly relic glowing tantalizingly in the distance. But the final obstacle looms ahead - a narrow, unstable bridge that threatens to send you all tumbling into the depths below. It won't hold all of you at once. Time is running out, and the charge on your flashlight is dwindling. The chasm seems to be closing in, as if it's trying to swallow you whole. With each step, you feel the weight of the task at hand. The fate of your team, and perhaps even the world, rests on your shoulders. Can you summon the courage and skill to make it across in time, and claim the relic that lies just beyond your grasp?

Much like janken, upon connecting to this docker you're met with a prompt that *really* wants you to tell it something

Let's see the instructions on how to play this game

☠️  [*] The path ahead is treacherous.                                         ☠️
☠️  [*] You have to find a viable strategy to get everyone across safely.      ☠️
☠️  [*] The bridge can hold a maximum of two persons.                          ☠️
☠️  [*] The chasm lurks on either side of the bridge waiting for those         ☠️
☠️      who think they can get across in total darkness.                       ☠️
☠️  [*] If two persons get across, one must come back with the flashlight.     ☠️
☠️  [*] The flashlight has energy only for a limited amount of time.           ☠️
☠️  [*] The time required for two persons to cross, is dictated by the slower. ☠️
☠️  [*] The answer must be given in crossing and returning pairs. For example, ☠️
☠️      [1,2],[2],... . This means that persons 1 and 2 cross and 2 gets back  ☠️
☠️       with the flashlight so others can cross.                              ☠️
☠️                                                                             ☠️
